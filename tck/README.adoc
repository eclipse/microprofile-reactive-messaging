= MicroProfile Reactive Messaging TCK

This project contains the TCK for Reactive Messaging


== Checking an implementation against the TCK

In your implementation, create a new module depending on the TCK artifact:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile-reactive-messaging-tck</artifactId>
    <version>${microprofile-reactive-messaging.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Your test project that runs the TCK is also very likely to depend on your implementation project.

As the tests are implemented in the TCK artifacts, you need to configure your test run to scan the tests included
in this artifact. With Maven it's done using the following plugin configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>2.22.1</version>
      <configuration>
        <dependenciesToScan>org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging:microprofile-reactive-messaging-tck</dependenciesToScan>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

Finally, because the tests are going to package the "checked" application against your extension, you need to implement
the `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.tck.ArchiveExtender` SPI that lets you add the classes required by your
implementation into the tested application.

The SPI must be implemented in your project and declare in the
`META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.tck.ArchiveExtender` file.
